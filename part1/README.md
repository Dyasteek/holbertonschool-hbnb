# HBnB Evolution - Technical Documentation

## Project Overview

HBnB Evolution is a simplified version of an AirBnB-like application that allows users to manage properties, reviews, and amenities. This project focuses on creating comprehensive technical documentation for the application's architecture and design.

## Features

### User Management
- User registration and profile management
- User identification (regular users vs administrators)
- Profile updates and deletion

### Place Management
- Property listing with details (title, description, price, location)
- Geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude)
- Owner association
- Amenity associations

### Review Management
- User reviews for visited places
- Rating and comment system
- Review management (create, update, delete, list)

### Amenity Management
- Amenity creation and management
- Association with places
- CRUD operations for amenities

## Architecture

The application follows a three-layer architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Services and API for user interaction
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Models and core application logic
3. **Persistence Layer**: Database storage and retrieval

## Technical Requirements

- All entities have unique IDs
- Creation and update timestamps for audit purposes
- UML notation for all diagrams
- Facade pattern for layer communication

## Project Structure

This project includes:
- High-level package diagrams
- Detailed class diagrams for business logic
- Sequence diagrams for API interactions
- Comprehensive technical documentation

## Documentation Deliverables

1. **Package Diagram**: Three-layer architecture overview
2. **Class Diagram**: Detailed business logic layer design
3. **Sequence Diagrams**: API interaction flows
4. **Technical Document**: Complete compilation of all diagrams

## Resources

- UML Basics and OOP concepts
- Package, Class, and Sequence diagram guides
- Mermaid.js and draw.io for diagram creation

## Expected Outcome

Complete technical documentation that serves as a blueprint for the HBnB Evolution application implementation, ensuring clear understanding of the system's design and architecture.
